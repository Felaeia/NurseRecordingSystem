# Overview
The Patient Tracker System backend is a C# ASP.NET Core Web API designed to assist 
communication between students and clinic nurses. It manages patient form submissions, 
notifications, medicine inventory, and clinic status updates with real-time synchronization 
across mobile and web clients.

This system ensures that students can quickly report health issues while nurses receive timely notifications, 
manage patient records, and keep the clinic’s operational status and inventory updated.
